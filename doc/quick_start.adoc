=== Set up a `tag` device
The UWB device with `role` set to `tag` is the device **to be located** relative to the `anchor` devices.

Minimal ESPHome YAML `tag` configuration:
[source]
----
uwb:
  role: tag
  device_id: 0x02   # unique ID of this device

  # For role=tag, a list of anchors is required:
  #  1 anchor: only distance between tag and anchor is produced.
  #  2+ anchors are needed for producing a 2D location.
  #     More anchors will result in better location precision.
  anchors:
    - device_id: 0xA1        # unique ID of an anchor device
      latitude: 48.1234567   # WGS 84 latitude of the anchor device
      longitude: 11.1234567  # WGS 84 longitude of the anchor device
    - device_id: 0xA2        # unique ID of another anchor device
      latitude: 48.1234568   # WGS 84 latitude of the anchor device
      longitude: 11.1234568  # WGS 84 longitude of the anchor device
sensor:
    # Latitude, Longitude of tag
  - platform: uwb
    latitude:
      id: uwb_tag_latitude
      name: "latitude"
    longitude:
      id: uwb_tag_longitude
      name: "longitude"

=== Set up multiple `anchor` devices
UWB devices with `role` set to `anchor` are fixed devices with a **known location**. These allow the `tag` to calculate its location.
The location (WGS 84 latitude and longitude) of the `anchor` **must** be provided in the `tag` YAML.
